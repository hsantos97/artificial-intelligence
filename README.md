## Description:
This is a n-queen problem solver using local search algorithms.

### Local search algorithms

- Hill Climbing
- Hill Climbing with random restart
- Simulated Annealing

### Heuristic/Heur√≠stica:

To solve this problem we used as a heuristic the number of pairs of queens attacking each other, either directly or indirectly.
